# Customer Churn Prediction Tutorial Using GraphLab Create #
The iPython notebook in this folder is a tutorial provided by Turi during the 2016 
Data Science Summit in San Francisco, CA. It's a very straightforward notebook 
and shows how analyses such as churn prediction can be peformed much more quickly 
using GraphLab Create than it would be using scikit-learn. 

Also, for what it's worth, the churn prediction model that Turi utilizes in the 
notebook is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting" target="_blank">Gradient Boosted Decision Trees</a> 
under the hood.
